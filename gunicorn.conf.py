"""Gunicorn configuration.

Gunicorn automatically loads this file when it is present in the working
directory, so it applies on Azure App Service without changing the
Oryx-generated startup command.

Note: settings passed on the command line take precedence over this file.
The Oryx default command supplies --bind and --timeout, so those are
intentionally not set here.
